## 🌐 **How the Web Works**

The web is a vast network connecting billions of devices worldwide. When you type a website address (like `www.google.com`) in your browser, here’s what happens:

1. The **browser** sends a request through the **internet** to a **web server**.  
2. The **server** receives the request and sends back the website’s files.  
3. The **browser** interprets the files (HTML, CSS, JS) and displays the page on your screen.

## 🧱 **Introduction to HTML**

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the foundation of every webpage.  
It defines the structure of content using *tags* such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and more.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Crazy Nets!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your first web development lesson.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 🎨 **HTML, CSS & JavaScript Relationship**

Every webpage you see is built using **three key technologies**:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| **HTML** | Structure and content |
| **CSS** | Styling and layout |
| **JavaScript** | Interactivity and dynamic behavior |

Together, they form the foundation of all web development.
